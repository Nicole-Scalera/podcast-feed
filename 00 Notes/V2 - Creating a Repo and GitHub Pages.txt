V2 - Creating a Repo and GitHub Pages

A. General Notes
- Create a new repo for this project.
- Need to grab files from the sample code repo: https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/github-practical-actions-4412872

B. Code Samples
- Go to 01_02b branch, grab the following items:
	- audio (folder)
	- images (folder)
	- README-feed.md
	- feed.yaml
- Download ZIP file and extract these contents into repo.

C. Edit Files
- Rename the README-feed.md file as README.md to act as the repo's official README.

D. GitHub Pages
- Go to Settings > GitHub Pages.
- For Source option, stay with "Deploy from a branch"
- For Branch option, stay with main and root folder.
- Then hit Save and give it time to deploy.
- Once done, it will give you a URL to find page.
	- Page should display README file.
- Can edit URL to access any other files on the page as well.

E. GitHub Actions
- Even though we didn't use "GitHub Actions" for Source, this does count as an action, which will appear in the Actions tab.
- GitHub Actions ran a workflow that created the page.
