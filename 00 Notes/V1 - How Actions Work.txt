V1 - GitHub Actions

A. General Notes
- GitHub Actions make it easier to automate project and tasks.
- This can be on a timer, or when a specific event occurs.
	- e.g. pushing a new branch, opening a PR.

- You can create your own actions or use pre-built ones.
	- See GitHub marketplace.

B. Course Overview
- Narrator (Ray Villaobos) will be constructing a feed for a podcast.
- Technical details:
	1. XML files, RSS format.
		- RSS is a markup language like HTML, but it's specifically used for syndicating XML content.
		- Usually used for news and podcast content.
	2. YAML Syntax
		- Ray will also be writing in the YAML Syntax to write information about his podcast.
	3. GitHub Action
		- Lastly, he will use a GitHub Action to generate the podcast feed.
		- He's using an action because "XML and RSS are difficult to create."

C. Building Actions
- GitHub Pages
	- Can host static pages for free.
- Python
	- Will be using Python to parse YAML into XML.
- Docker
	- Will need Docker file to publish to GitHub marketplace.
	- GitHub actions utilizes this to build a container that will run our action in the cloud.
- Bash Scripting
	- Will need bash scripts to run Python files and also make sure changes are pushed back to GitHub.

D. Sample Code
- Ray shared some sample code on this repo: https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/github-practical-actions-4412872
