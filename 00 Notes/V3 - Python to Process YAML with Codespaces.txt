V3 - Python to Process YAML with Codespaces

A. General Notes
- Created a codespace on main.
- This is so that I don't have to install all the packages on my local.
	- However, I will still take notes locally.

B. Set up Feed.py
- Create python file feed.py.
- Import the following packages:
	- yaml
	- xml.etree.ElementTree as "xml_tree"
- Open feed.yaml document and load it into a variable called yaml_data.
- Use safe_load to load up the file.

C. RSS Feed Sample
- Set up RSS Feed Sample with simple rss element.
	- In the element, create an rss tag.
- For attributes, convert equals (=) to colons (:).
- Also convert double quotes to single.
- Move all the attributes into the rss element.

D. Apple Sample Code
- Ray is using "A Podcaster's Guide to RSS" from Apple for RSS reference.
- Notes that the <channel> tag has most of the information about the podcast channel.

E. Creating Channel Tag
- channel_element is a sub element of the xml tree.
- This will go inside the rss element and will just be called "channel"
	- Won't have any sub data for now.
- In xml_treeSubElement, we target the channel_element and give it a "title" tag.
- Put text in there that grabs data from the yaml file.
	- All that data from the yaml file is now in an object called yaml_data.

F. Output
- Create output_tree that is an xml_tree element.
- The element we built is going to be fed into the output tree, which will send it out into a separate file.
- Write file with the following attributes:
	- 'podcast.xml'
	- encoding='UTF-8'
	- xml_declaration=True
- Pull up terminal and execute with "python feed.py"
- This will create a new file named podcast.xml, which contains the data we put together in feed.py
